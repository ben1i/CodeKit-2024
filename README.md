## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-web-elements.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd simple-web-elements
    ```

3. Link the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project.

## Usage

Each component is located in its own folder with corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You can copy the code for each element and include it directly in your project, or adapt it as necessary.

For example, to add the **Back to Top Button**:
1. Include the `back-to-top.css` file in your `<head>` tag:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/back-to-top.css">
    ```

2. Add the `back-to-top.js` file before the closing `</body>` tag:
    ```html
    <script src="path/to/back-to-top.js"></script>
    ```

3. Place the button HTML in your desired location:
    ```html
    <button id="back-to-top">Top</button>
    ```

## Elements

### 1. Back to Top Button

A floating button that appears when the user scrolls down the page, allowing them to quickly navigate back to the top. 

### 2. Burger Menu

A responsive hamburger-style navigation menu that collapses on smaller screens and expands when clicked.

### 3. Dark Mode Toggle

A simple toggle switch that enables dark mode across the website, enhancing user experience for those who prefer darker themes.

### 4. Parallax Scrolling

Implements a parallax effect where background images scroll slower than the foreground content, creating a sense of depth.

### 5. Progress Bar

A dynamic progress bar that visually indicates the user's scroll progress on the page.

### 6. Image Slider

A simple and responsive slider for images or content that allows users to cycle through multiple slides.

### 7. Sticky Navigation

A navigation bar that sticks to the top of the viewport when the user scrolls past it, ensuring easy access to navigation at all times.

### 8. Tab Menu

A tabbed interface that allows users to switch between different content sections without reloading the page.

## Customization

Each element comes with basic styles and functionality, but you can easily customize them to match your websiteâ€™s theme. Modify the CSS files to change colors, fonts, or layout. You can also adjust the JavaScript functionality to add or remove features as needed.
